Linux From Scratch pacman project by Armin K.

This repository contains set of scripts used to build a temporary
toolchain as used by the Linux From Scratch project which is
required to build my personal Linux From Scratch pacman managed
distribution located at https://github.com/elkrejzi/pacman

These scripts build so called "Chapter 5" of the Linux From Scratch
book (usually the SVN version of the book), with some additions
specific to this project, and are only meant to be used on 64 bit
distributions.

More packages were added to support pacman package manager, as well
some extras, such as the nano editor, wget utility and a special
toolchain, used on my system. Pacman is configured to use clang as
a system compiler, as well to apply set of compiler flags specific
to my own machine. If you decide to use these scripts, make sure you
change them to fit you. Glibc is built twice, once for 64 bit, once
for 32 bit, in order for final system to be able to utilize multilib.

How to use:

 - Make sure all the sources are downloaded. Scripts can download the
   necessary sources automatically. Just run
   "/path/to/repo/bootstrap/001_binutils_pass1 fetch" from a directory
   you want to download them to. Make sure to adjust SROOT in
   /path/to/repo/bootstrap/000_shared to point to the downloads
   location. Default package location is /path/to/repo/sources,
   no matter where this repo is cloned.

 - Set LFS in /path/to/repo/bootstrap/000_shared to the desired mount
   point for LFS (default is /mnt/lfs) and mount the partition there.

 - Create $LFS/tools and symlink /tools to it (mkdir $LFS/tools ;
   ln -sf $LFS/tools /tools as root), and change its permissions so
   it's writable by the user that's going to run these scripts.

 - Issue /path/to/repo/bootstrap from a directory that's on partition
   with enough of space and is writable by the user LFS is being built
   as (separate user isn't required, any user can be used (not sure
   about root)) to start building the toolchain.

 - Backup $LFS/tools in case something goes wrong further along the
   way.
